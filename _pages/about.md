I am a 3rd year Ph.D candidate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University majoring in Food Science and Technology. I am co-supervised by [NA.Qingping Wu](https://ysg.ckcest.cn/html/details/4959/index.html) in [Institute of Biology, Guang Dong](http://www.gdim.cn) and [Dr.Dapeng Wang](http://www.agri.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/4421) in SJTU.

My research interests include: Combining the next-generation sequencing technology with food-borne virus detection to optimize food-borne virus detection technology. With norovirus as the entry point, methods are optimized and standard processes are designed from the pre-processing process of virus extraction to the database construction process and the subsequent data analysis process. At present, the optimization of the pre-processing process of food samples is being carried out to strive to obtain norovirus from food samples as soon as possible. My goal is to obtain the full-length genome of norovirus, providing information for the changes in "human-food-environment".
